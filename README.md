## Scripts To Assist in Running a World of Tanks Clan

get_cw_battle_count.py - a Python script that pulls the number of battles per player from the WG API. Requires an Aapplication ID, a clan ID and a Season ID.

lines2csv.plx - a Perl script that takes text cut and paste from the player list/table on a clan's portal page (e.g https://asia.wargaming.net/clans/wot/2000010912/players/#players&offset=0&limit=25&order=-role&timeframe=all&battle_type=default) and turns it into a CSV.
